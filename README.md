# [Tzoker Generator](https://tzoker-generator.web.app/)

### Features

- Get the current Tzoker status & the next draw date with a countdown timer
- Generate 5 numbers & 1 tzoker based on number delays. Currently the algorithm is not tweakable (will eventually be available on future release):
  - 1 number with delay >= 20 draws
  - 2 numbers with delay <= 4 draws
  - 1 number with delay > 10 & <= 20 draws
  - 1 number with delay <=10 & > 4 draws
  - Tzoker is a number with delay > 10 draws
- Check all Tzoker draws with detailed stats about number delays and occurences
- Pressing <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> anytime, will bring up the numbers' screen where you can tap a number and check its stats
- At `Search` page, you check for specific number combinations if they ever appeared in a draw
